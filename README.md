Project Outline and Scope

This is the project file for a DIY plc trainer.  The trainer combines the power and flexibility of a raspberry pi with everything youâ€™d expect from a traditional plc trainer.  The raspberry pi acts as an HMI that the user can connect to with any WIFI enabled device.  Through the HMI, the trainee can read inputs, toggle outputs, and send messages to the PLC to trigger other options.  The raspberry pi also acts as an input simulator, so there is no need for additional hardware in the form of sensors etc.  All the outputs from the plc merely energize leds to ensure a safe learning environment.

The scope of this trainer is to primarily provide the trainee with the essentials to get up and running with writing ladder logic programs for the plc.  Trainees will also be exposed to a range industry standard hardware and practices in process of building his own trainer.  However, some standards and practices are intentionally omitted for the purposes of minimizing cost and time investments during the building process (i.e omitting main & branch circuit breakers).

Provided for this project are:
- sample code for both plc and raspberry pi
- source code for HMI
- electrical drawings and circuit schematics
- demonstrative  media
