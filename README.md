Project Outline and Scope

This is the project file for a DIY PLC trainer.  The trainer utlizies a Raspberry Pi along with a Click PLC.  The Raspberry pi acts as an HMI that the user can connect to with any WIFI enabled device with a browser.  Through the HMI, the trainee can read inputs, toggle outputs, and send messages to the PLC to trigger other options.  The Raspberry Pi simulates all digital input signals to the PLC, so there is no need for additional hardware in the form of sensors etc.

The scope of this trainer is to primarily provide the trainee with the essentials to get up and running with developing ladder logic programs for a PLC.  Trainees will also be exposed to a range of industry standard hardware and practices in process of building their own trainer.  However, some standards and practices are intentionally omitted for the purposes of minimizing cost and space requirements.

Provided for this project are:
- source code for PLC and Raspberry Pi
- source code for HMI
- electrical drawing
- circuit schematic
